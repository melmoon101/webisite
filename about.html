<h2>Main article: History of auto racing<h2>

<p id="list">Auto racing (also known as car racing, motor racing, or automobile racing) is a motorsport involving the racing of automobiles for competition.
Almost as soon as automobiles had been invented,
 races of various sorts were organised,
  with the first recorded as early as 1867.
   Many of the earliest events were effectively reliability trials,
    aimed at proving these new machines were a practical mode of transport,
     but soon became an important way for competing makers to demonstrate their machines.
By the 1930s specialist racing cars had developed. </p>

<h1>When Was the First Race Car Invented?</h1>
<p id="list1">While the first official automobile race was held in Paris in 1894,
 it was not until 1898 that the first car designed specifically for speed was built by Camille Jenatzy.
 He would later become the first person to drive an automobile at speeds higher than 62 mph.
After the first race in Paris,
 organized automobile racing spread to the United States.
 The first race was held in 1895 on Thanksgiving Day.
 Racing enthusiasm quickly spread around the world.
  Races in Europe were fairly common by the 1900s.
 In the 1930s, drag racing became common in the United States,
   due to the improvements in vehicle design and technology<p>
